# memory_buffer_register

Memory Buffer Register (MBR) is the register of a computer's control unit that contains the data after a fetch from the computerâ€™s storage. It acts like a buffer and holds anything that is copied from the memory ready for the processor to use it. This prototype aims to replicate the working of MBR in one direction i.e., write and read data from another register.

MBR uses SPI protocol for communication with the Micro-controller. SPI devices communicate in full duplex mode using a master-slave architecture with a single master. Read and write speeds upto 2 MBPS is achieved.
